  </div>

  <p class="lead">
    Welcome to <strong>Puspa Kamal Wooden Furnitures</strong>. We truly appreciate your trust in our craftsmanship. Please read these Terms &amp; Conditions carefully before placing your order. These terms explain the relationship between you (the customer) and us (the manufacturer) and are designed to make every project clear, fair and professional.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Made-to-Order Policy</h2>
  <p class="small">
    All furniture from Puspa Kamal Wooden Furnitures is <span class="highlight">made to order</span>. Production begins only after your order is confirmed and we have received the required advance payment. Each item is handcrafted to your specifications — measurements, design and finish — so please confirm all details before placing your order.
  </p>
  <div class="note">
    <strong>Important:</strong> Because every product is custom-built, cancellations or refunds are generally not possible once work has started. Please finalise your design, material choices and measurements before confirmation.
  </div>

  <h2>2. Raw Materials (Customer‑Supplied Option)</h2>
  <p class="small">
    If you choose to provide your own raw materials (wood, plywood, hardware, polish, etc.), we will charge only for labour and any finishing or detailing work requested.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Materials you supply must be of adequate quality and suitable for the agreed design.</li>
    <li>We are not responsible for delays or defects arising from customer-supplied materials.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Pricing &amp; Payment Terms</h2>
  <p class="small">
    After finalising your order we will provide a detailed quotation that includes material costs (if we provide them), labour, and any additional customisation or finishing charges.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Advance Payment:</strong> A portion of the total cost is required as an advance to confirm the order and start work.</li>
    <li><strong>Progress Payments (Optional):</strong> You may make partial payments while work is in progress if preferred.</li>
    <li><strong>Final Payment:</strong> The remaining balance is due on completion and before or at the time of delivery.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="small">Accepted payment methods: bank transfer, UPI or other mutually agreed methods.</p>

  <h2>4. Delivery &amp; Shipping</h2>
  <p class="small">
    We can arrange delivery vehicles for you upon request. Delivery charges are paid by the customer and vary according to distance, product size and vehicle availability. Delivery dates will be communicated at order confirmation, but may change due to weather, logistics or other unforeseen events. We hold authenticated business documents required for transport and verification, enabling us to deliver anywhere.
  </p>
  <p class="small">You may also choose to arrange your own delivery if you prefer.</p>

  <h2>5. Product Quality &amp; Inspection</h2>
  <p class="small">
    Every item is inspected for quality, finish and durability before dispatch. Wood is a natural material — slight variations in color, grain or texture are normal and part of its character, and are not considered defects.
  </p>
  <p class="small">Customers are welcome to visit and inspect their product during production by prior appointment.</p>

  <h2>6. Order Timeline</h2>
  <p class="small">
    Completion time depends on complexity, size and material availability. We provide an estimated delivery date at confirmation and will communicate promptly if any delay occurs.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Warranty &amp; After‑Sales</h2>
  <p class="small">
    We stand by our workmanship. Where applicable, warranty covers manufacturing defects only. The warranty does not cover natural wear and tear, damage due to mishandling, water exposure, pests, improper maintenance, or alterations made after delivery. Please follow our care instructions to ensure long-lasting performance.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Cancellations &amp; Refunds</h2>
  <p class="small">
    Because our products are custom-made:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Cancellations after work has begun are not accepted.</li>
    <li>Advance payments are non-refundable, as they cover materials and labour already initiated.</li>
    <li>In exceptional situations, mutually agreed design changes or adjustments may be discussed and handled fairly.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>9. Ownership</h2>
  <p class="small">
    Ownership of the finished product remains with <strong>Puspa Kamal Wooden Furnitures</strong> until full payment is received. Once the balance amount is cleared, ownership transfers to the customer.
  </p>

  <h2>10. Communication &amp; Updates</h2>
  <p class="small">
    We provide regular updates about your order and can share photos or videos of progress on request. Workshop visits are welcome by prior appointment.
  </p>

  <h2>11. Legal &amp; Documentation</h2>
  <p class="small">
    We are a fully authenticated business and can provide production, transport and trade documents on request. Any dispute will be resolved under the jurisdiction of local laws where the business is registered.
